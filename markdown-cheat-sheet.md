# Markdown Cheat Sheet

Thanks for visiting [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)!

This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax).

## Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.

### Italic

*italicized text*

### Blockquote

### Ordered List

2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List

## Extended Syntax

These elements extend the basic syntax by adding additional features. Not all Markdown applications support these elements.

### Table

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

### Fenced Code Block

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

### Footnote

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

### Heading ID

### My Great Heading {#custom-id}

### Definition List

term
: definition

~~The world is flat.~~

### Highlight

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.

### Subscript

H~2~O

### Superscript

X^2^
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

## inline HTML
